Overview
========
PSLib is a PHP library for generating PostScript files for the PHP free 
scripting language. It offers an easy way of generating PostScript text 
and graphics with support for drawing. Call PSlib functions from within
your PHP script and voila: dynamic PS files!

The functions should be quite self-explainable and somehow mimic the well
known proprietary PDFlib which generates dynamic PDF files. 

Take a look at file CHANGES and make the changes to your old code (prior version 0.03).


Supported Programming Environments
==================================
The PSLib was developed for usage within a PHP script only. Along with 
this distribution there is an example called historico.php where PSlib is
used.
